# open-source-communication
This unprecedented project aims to create an open source telecommunications network. The idea is to create an internet network using open source wireless hardware. 

Each user also becomes a node, contributing to network traffic.

The advantage of maintaining open source communication equipment is browsing free from the control of governments and internet service providers.

Freedom. Let's rescue the essence of the internet.
